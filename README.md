> BQQ is being constructed!

BQQ stands for **B**est **Q**uora **Q**uestion (from my view). As a Quora user, I know there is a huge and precious resource for all. I tried to search a collection of best Quora question (belongs to best answer) but it did not help. That means I should make my own list manually. It's OK, I created this repository. First, for saving Quora questions I have read, easy to retrieve (I don't like **Follow** button on Quora page, always has more than 200 notifications at right corner). Second, for sharing and hope that Github users also like Quora and willing to contribute to this collection. Don't hesitate to send a PR. You're always welcome!
